# Parkinson-s-disease-classification
Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects motor 
control but also manifests in non-motor symptoms, including speech impairments. These speech issues, 
often evident in the early stages, provide an opportunity for non-invasive diagnosis through voice 
analysis. This study aims to investigate the efficiency of deep learning architectures, specifically 1D 
Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and 1D AlexNet, in classifying Parkinsons disease using 
voice and speech features.
